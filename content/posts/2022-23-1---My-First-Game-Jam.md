Pretty much a few hours before I started this blog post [Godot Wild Jam](https://godotwildjam.com) #41 has just ended. This was the first game jam I joined and I was able to make a messy buggy and **COMPLETE** game.

## What's a Game jam?

If you don't know what a game jam is its pretty much a event where developers, artist and game musicians team up(or compete solo) to create a video game in a set amount of time. Some game jams are a weekend, some are a week, some are a month and there is one that last just about [1 hour](https://onehourgamejam.com). The events can be virtual or physical, some can have up to 100 entries while some only have a few. Most also have a theme to make your game around. Some famous game jams are [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com), [Nordic Game Jam](https://nordicgamejam.com) and [GMTK Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2021)

## Why did you do a game jam

I have been interested with the Godot game engine since Spring 2020 when I was locked in my home due to the deadly virus that wiped sanity off from the face of the earth. Usually I would follow a tutorial to make a platformer with a few assets I found around the net and complete the tutorial with those instead. But tutorials can only take you so far, without scrambling around documentations there isn't any learning experience. Usually with game jams there are themes and themes help bring in innovation and thinking. With a tutorial you only get a basic barebone platformer that you got off of youtube. With a game jam you get a pinball RPG platformer that takes place in the 1780s France that you got off of your thinking and planning skills(as well as some youtube videos). Basically with game jams you get a lot more ideas and you can work with a team as well.

## Godot Wild Jam Begin!

The theme for Godot Wild Jam #41 was "Ocean". There were also wildcard themes added that were optional but did help with the thinking process around the theme. I decided to create a fishing game where you play an Inuit trapped on an iceberg and throw spears to hunt fish in 60 seconds. I tried to keep things simple. GWJ has a time limit of 9 days which seems like an ampled amount of time and for some it is. But as a full time developer working weekdays I am grateful for the 9 days as I get to work on the game fully on weekends and I do some leet developing on Friday nights.

Next blog post I hope to explain how I developed this atrocity of a game.
