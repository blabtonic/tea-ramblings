Hey there! Hopefully this blog actually last for awhile compared to the blogs I created in the past. The main purpose for this blog is to document some things I have created on the web and game development progress on games created using the amazing gaming engine: Godot Engine. Fairly new to game development but I have been developing for 8 years as a hobby and as an occupation as well.
